# BH Checkers 2 #

I made this as one of my first programming projects after learning Java, in 2010.

This is a GUI-based reimagining of [BH Checkers 1](https://github.com/BlueHuskyStudios/BH-Checkers-1). It was never finished, but I learned a lot about GUI programming and design while doing it.

This is definitely an example of **how to not** do stuff, but I'm a huge proponent of being proud of growth. If anything shows my growth, it's definitely this and [my old Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://github.com/BenLeggiero/TicTacToe). Enjoy looking through here!
